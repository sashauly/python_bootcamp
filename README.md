### General rules

- Your scripts should not quit unexpectedly (giving an error on a valid input). If this happens, your project will be considered non functional and will receive a 0 during the evaluation.
- We encourage you to create test programs for your project even though this work won't have to be submitted and won't be graded. It will give you a chance to easily test your work and your peers' work. You will find those tests especially useful during your defence. Indeed, during defence, you are free to use your tests and/or the tests of the peer you are evaluating.
- It is recommended to have Python at least version 3.7+ (and definitely NOT <3.4).
- It is recommended (though not strictly required) that your code is formatted according to [PEP8 style guides](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/).
